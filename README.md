Just a simple idea to make every witcher's life easier. No more libraries, just one, mobile source of monsters details.

# why?
I just wanted to get more familiar with Bootstrap 4.0.0 so I've made index with `card` and `flexbox`. Monster details (only crones available for now) are plain Bootstrap's columns.
Nothing impressive but still I have fun doing it.
